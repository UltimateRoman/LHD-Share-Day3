### Completed challenges

1. Explore Hardware: Whether or not you have hardware at home, we want you to explore a hardware hack. Check out an emulator or use hardware you have around your house.

2. Write Code to Sort a List: This is a classic problem in computer science for a reason. If you’re new to hacking, keep it simple! If you’re one of our more experienced hackers, try this in a new language or without leveraging search engines.
